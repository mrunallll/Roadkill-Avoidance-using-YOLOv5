# Roadkill-Avoidance-using-YOLOv5
A Roadkill Avoidance Framework using YOLOv5 and custom dataset

We often use object detection for detecting objects/being on the road for safety purposes. But do we care to check if the data that we are trianing our object detection model on, is valid and accurate enough? Rarely.
This is documentation for an upcoming research-work, the custom-data for which will be released soon.

The flow for the project is as depicted below:
